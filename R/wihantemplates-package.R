#' @description An R package comprising--hopefully, one day--a suite of
#' templates for the creation documents in **R Markdown** which I've come to use
#' on a regular basis. The package is still in its experimental stage and I'll
#' be working out the kinks. The best way to contribute to its development and
#' address its inevitable problems is by logging a new issue
#' [here](https://github.com/WihanZA/wihantemplates/issues).
#'
#' @section Features:
#' **Templates:**
#' - `dissertation`: All the necessary materials for honours, master's and
#'   doctoral students using R Markdown to produce dissertations and theses
#'   conforming to the requirements of Stellenbosch University. The template
#'   heavily relies on the excellent suite of LaTeX packages,
#'   [`stellenbosch-2`](https://ctan.org/pkg/stellenbosch-2), created and
#'   maintained by [Daniel Els](mailto:dnjels@sun.ac.za).
#' - `invoice`: Create professional invoices with customizable fields for client
#'   and author information, support for importing timesheet data, automatic
#'   calculation of billable amounts, and sections for payment details.
#' - `manuscript`: Create professional academic manuscripts with proper formatting
#'   for sections, equations, tables, figures, citations, cross-references,
#'   footnotes, and acronyms. The template uses clean typography with sensible
#'   defaults and produces publication-ready PDF documents.
