  abstract = {This paper extends the structural gravity model to incorporate scale effects and exchange rate passthrough. Bilateral scale effects in cross-border trade are inferred from the difference in distance elasticities between cross border and inter-provincial bilateral trade in a majority of 28 goods and services sectors for Canada's provinces. Bilateral-specific relationship investment is a possible explanation. Incomplete passthrough of large exchange rate changes from 1997 to 2007, amplified by scale effects, produces direct effects on bilateral trade for 12 of 19 goods sectors but none of 9 services sectors.}

  abstract = {Gravity equations have been widely used to infer trade flow effects of various institutional arrangements. We show that estimated gravity equations do not have a theoretical foundation. This implies both that estimation suffers from omitted variables bias and that comparative statics analysis is unfounded. We develop a method that (i) consistently and efficiently estimates a theoretical gravity equation and (ii) correctly calculates the comparative statics of trade frictions. We apply the method to solve the famous McCallum border puzzle. Applying our method, we find that national borders reduce trade between industrialized countries by moderate amounts of 20--50 percent.},
