```{r projected-duration, include = FALSE}
# code chunk to assist user in determining timeline
start <- today()
finish <- ymd("2025-06-30")

if (finish <= start) stop("`start` must be < `finish`")

duration <- difftime(
  finish,
  start,
  units = "weeks",
  tz = Sys.timezone()
) %>%
  ceiling() %>%
  format(units = "weeks")
```

The following timeline represents preliminary estimates and will be finalised upon your acceptance:

- Start date: TBD
