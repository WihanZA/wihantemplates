It features a structured directory organization, customizable YAML fields for metadata, bilingual support for English and Afrikaans content, and proper formatting for abstracts, acknowledgements, chapters, bibliography, and appendices. The template relies heavily on the excellent suite of $\LaTeX$ packages, [`stellenbosch-2`](https://ctan.org/pkg/stellenbosch-2), created and maintained by [Daniel Els](mailto:dnjels@sun.ac.za).
