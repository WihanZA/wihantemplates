`wihantemplates` is an R package comprising--hopefully one day--a suite of templates for the creation of **R Markdown** documents, and in turn, PDFs which I have come to use on a regular basis.
The package is still in its experimental stage, so please be patient while I work out the kinks.
The best way to contribute to its development and address the problems which will inevitably arise is by logging a new issue [here](https://github.com/WihanZA/wihantemplates/issues).

## Getting Started

You can install the development version of `wihantemplates` from Github via the [`remotes`](https://github.com/r-lib/remotes#readme) package.

```r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("WihanZA/wihantemplates")
```

Ensure that you have the appropriate R packages installed and loaded:

```r
install.packages(c("tinytex", "rmarkdown"))
library(tinytex)
library(rmarkdown)
```
Since all templates in this package rely on TinyTeX, you must have both the `tinytex` package and the TinyTeX LaTeX distribution installed on your machine. You can test and install them as follows:

```r
# Check if tinytex package is installed
if (!requireNamespace("tinytex", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("tinytex")
}

# Load the tinytex package
library(tinytex)

# Check if TinyTeX distribution is installed
if (!tinytex::is_tinytex() || is.null(tinytex::tinytex_root())) {
  tinytex::install_tinytex()
}
```

To ensure that all necessary LaTeX packages and dependencies are available, especially those not included in the TinyTeX distribution by default, you can use `tinytex::parse_install()` function. This reads the log file from a failed LaTeX compilation, identifies the missing packages, and installs them.

```r
# Parse the log file and install missing LaTeX packages
tinytex::parse_install("su_dissertation.log")
```

This command helps manage dependencies efficiently by installing only the required packages, making your LaTeX setup more streamlined and less bloated.


## Usage

Once the package has been installed, it is quite simple to use a particular template.
In RStudio, go to `File > New File > R Markdown > From Template` and select your desired template from the list. My templates are those denoted with `{wihantemplates}` alongside templates' names.
For now, the package includes only the `su_dissertation` template.

## `su_dissertation`

### Stellenbosch University Dissertation Template

All the necessary materials for doctoral and master's students using R Markdown to produce dissertations and theses conforming to the requirements of Stellenbosch University. The template heavily relies on the excellent suite of $\LaTeX$ packages, [`stellenbosch-2`](https://ctan.org/pkg/stellenbosch-2), created and maintained by [Daniel Els](mailto:dnjels@sun.ac.za).


#### Template directory

``` latex
template
├── cache
├── code
├── data
├── figures
├── matter
│   ├── abstract.Rmd
│   ├── acknowledgements.Rmd
│   ├── appendix.Rmd
│   ├── mybib.bib
│   └── nomenclature.Rmd
├── styles
│   ├── defaults.R
│   └── template.tex
├── su_dissertation.pdf
├── su_dissertation.Rmd
└── su_dissertation.tex
```
#### Spacing

Given the particular setup of the template's document class and packages, the following $\LaTeX$ parameters produce skips, indents and separations of the sizes presented in the table below. The relevant parts of the template's setup is as follows:

``` latex
\documentclass[12pt,...]{stb-thesis}
\usepackage[a4paper, left=1in, right=1in, top=1in, bottom=1.25in]{geometry} \usepackage{setspace}
\usepackage[skip,parfill]{parskip} 
\setstretch{1.1}
```

*Point sizes of selected* $\LaTeX$ *parameters and units given the template's default settings.*
